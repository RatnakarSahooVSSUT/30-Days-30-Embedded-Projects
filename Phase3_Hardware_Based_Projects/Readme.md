# Phase 3 - Hardware Based Embedded Projects

This phase focuses on **hands-on, real hardware-based embedded system projects**.

All projects in this phase involve:
- Physical circuit connections
- Real sensors and actuators
- ESP32/Arduino hardware
- Breadboard-level implementation
- Practical debugging and testing

No simulations are used in this phase.  
Each project represents a **real-world hardware prototype**.
